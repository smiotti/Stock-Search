Assignment #6 - Stock Search Application 
 
This application can be used to find company stock prices and news. To add a company to the search list, simply type the symbol into the "Add a Stock Symbol" field and click "Submit".  A new button will be added.  To retrieve company stock prices and news, select the number of news articles you would like to receive, and then click the symbol button for that company.  Company Profile & News will appear at the bottom of the page.

Notice... based on the number of available news article for a given company at iexTrading API (data source), you may not receive the same number of articles back, that you selected.  

This project provides practical application of JavaScript, jQuery, and Ajax API calls to retrieve stock and company related data from a remote source [iexTrading API], build DOM elements which are then dynamically displayed back to the user on the webpage.
